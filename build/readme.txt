This is a Winamp-style audioplayer with all the basic functionality 
made with React and Howler.js. 
This is meant to be an Electron app, so you should run "npm install" and then
"npm run build" to make a desktop application before launching it, 
although you can certainly run it in the browser by opening "index.html".
